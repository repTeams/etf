        WHB4: '4.监管兼容性：区块链核心的理念是去中心化，许多区块链技术在设计之初即将中心化的政府视为对立面。 但不容否认 ，中心化依然是目前社会运行的主体模式，区块链的去中心化思维难免会和中心化的传统监管之间产生冲突和摩擦。 因此，公链架构中与现实中心化世界的兼容性设计将是公链大规模应用的前提。',
        WHB5: '5.共识机制：共识机制是区块链的灵魂，共识机制的设计决定了一条公链能否建立完善的激励机制，鼓励更多的节点参与其中，增加系统的去中心化属性。而在多数公链中，节点数量与传输速率呈负相关关系，节点数量和系统性能的平衡是共识机制需要考虑的另一个要素。',
        WHB6: '公有公有链开发涉及区块链底层设计原理，一条公链的设计，从一开始就需要有好的架构设计布局，包括系统的可扩展性和传输技术、系统安全问题、分布式存储、监管兼容性以及共识机制的设计，这些都需要有一个成熟的区块链开发团队才能完成，而且从事区块链开发的技术人员，相比传统开发人员 要求好高很多，因为本身区块链技术所涉及的知识就有比较管，包括了金融学、密码学等，因此这些都会是影响公有链开发的价格因素。',
        WHB7: '当我们在选择开发自己的公有链项目时，一定要选择一个成熟有这方面相关经验的开发团队，这样不仅能帮你理清开发需求问题，而且从技术和后期维护服务上会更加有保障，在开发的价格上也一定能够得到一个比较合适的价位，这样到后续也可以避开很多不必要的损失。',
